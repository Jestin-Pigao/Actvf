	STEPHEN RUGGIERO | Social Studies</font>
<p class="StaffMatters">Stephen's love for teaching was realized at an early age, as for his first part-time job as a high school student, he worked as a private cello lessons instructor, serving local elementary school students in his hometown on Long Island. Stephen studied History at SUNY New Paltz College, where he earned his BA, and subsequently studied Secondary Education with a concentration in Social Studies at CUNY Brooklyn College, where he earned his MA. He is deeply fascinated by politics, the production and interpretation of history, and the ongoing fight for civil/human rights worldwide. Beyond the parameters of education, Stephen is a passionate musician and producer who has an extensive live performance background and a vast array of musical tastes and influences. His experiences meeting and collaborating with musicians of various backgrounds and pedigrees have taught him a great deal of invaluable lessons in regards to the importance of democracy, multiculturalism, community, and transparency, in which he feels will strongly enhance his practice as a teacher, as a mentor, and as a colleague.
